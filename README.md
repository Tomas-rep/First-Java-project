# First-Java-project
Management app for a veterinary hotel that includes caretakers, veterinarians, and habitats with trees. 

Key Features
The app manages various animal species, with caretakers responsible for feeding and cleaning, and veterinarians ensuring animal health. Health tracking includes cases where improper vaccines affect an animalâ€™s well-being due to potential veterinary errors. Each habitat has trees, and the app can assess satisfaction levels for animals and staff. Identifiers and names are case-insensitive unless otherwise specified.

Note: This project uses a UI library specific to IST University, which is not included due to potential sharing restrictions.
