# First-Java-project
Management app for a veterinary hotel that includes caretakers, veterinarians, and habitats with trees. 

Key Features:
The app manages various animal species, with caretakers responsible for feeding and cleaning, and veterinarians ensuring animal health. Health tracking includes cases where improper vaccines affect an animal’s well-being due to potential veterinary errors. Each habitat has trees, and the app can assess the satisfaction levels for animals and staff. Identifiers and names are case-insensitive unless otherwise specified.

Note: This project uses a UI library specific to IST University, which is not included due to potential sharing restrictions.
